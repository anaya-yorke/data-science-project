## Conclusion

The analysis of sea level trends suggests an increase over the years. The trend observed within the data comes from the analysis of multiple USA coastlines, showing a rise throughout the years, from as early as the 1950s to 2015. This pattern, potentially attributed to climate change, indicates potential risks for increased environmental issues that could directly impact the ecosystems of both humans and animals.
